Impress Demo
------------

To get this demo going, navigate to the `public` directory and run `npm install`. That will install `impress` in your public folder (along with all it's dependencies).

Then go back to the `impress` directory and run `npm install` again - this will install the modules needed for the server in the example.

Finally, navigate back here to the `example` directory and run `node server`. This will start up an express server-side instance on port 3000. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the demo working.
